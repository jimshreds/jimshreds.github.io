[No Gall . No Glory](https://www.mixcloud.com/jimshreds/october-4-2020/) First show back in a while on WKDU. Was weird on a number of fronts. Talking into a mic that doesn't initially go anywhere is odd. In studio knowing there were people on the other end listening is different.

The workflow for this episode was weird and robotic... build playlist in iTunes ... hit play ... hit record in audio hijack ... import into Audacity ... cut 30 minute blocks. add prerecorded station ID or Public Service Announcement... read/record playlist... edit out bad words... export ... upload ... and wait to see if it all works. The loss of freeflow is definitely noticable.

In two weeks we go again. Learned a bunch from the first go round.
