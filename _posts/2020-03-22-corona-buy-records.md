Shit is hard right now. Below are a list of place I buy records from both IRL and online. Running a record shop ain't easy, especially when there's a pandemic.

* [Beautiful World](https://www.discogs.com/seller/philadelphiamusic/profile) - Philly
* [Extended Play](https://www.discogs.com/seller/extendedplay19971/profile) - Rehoboth
