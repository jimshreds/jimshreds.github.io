<p class="meta">19 Nov 2019</p>

<div class="post">
  <p>Recently passed a training course at Dogfish Head that started us on a path of being better tasters of beer. Beer is the sum of a few parts with intricate processes mixed in to help it along. A website is similar in that there are disparate parts that when combined create a new thing.</p>

<p>One of the core components to beer is the  hop, if you let it sit around it can start to stink of bad cheese and that off-flavor is called Isovaleric. This single thing can ruin a beer thats made up of many other ingredients and chained together processes.</p>

<p>Similarly, CSS is a core component of a web page and over time can begin to stink of outdated unused classes that bloat your page load times. Just like a stinky hop this bloated file could weigh down a page that needs to be loaded fast.</p>

<p>Brewers and developers must focus on and sweat the details in order to create an end product that meets and exceeds expectations. Whether it is hop quality, a well structured DOM, performant javascript, or boiling temperature a simple mis-step can ruin ruin a beer or page render.</p>
