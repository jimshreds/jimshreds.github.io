  <p><a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/jimshreds/october-4-2020/">No Gall . No Glory</a> First show back in a while on WKDU. Was weird on a number of fronts. Talking into a mic that doesn’t initially go anywhere is odd. In studio knowing there were people on the other end listening is different.</p>

<p>The workflow for this episode was weird and robotic… build playlist in iTunes … hit play … hit record in audio hijack … import into Audacity … cut 30 minute blocks. add prerecorded station ID or Public Service Announcement… read/record playlist… edit out bad words… export … upload … and wait to see if it all works. The loss of freeflow is definitely noticable.</p>

<p>In two weeks we go again. Learned a bunch from the first go round.</p>
